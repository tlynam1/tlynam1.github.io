One-year Santa brought the Lynam's more than just toys for Christmas. Instead of getting tooth paste and candy in their
stockings, Tom and Miranda were thrilled to find a happy little puppy peeping his head out of the top of one on
Christmas morning. Do to the actuation they believed that naming the new addition to the family after Rodolph.

Rudy was a small yorke that seemed to never outgrow the stage of being a puppy. His puppy parson did not stop at his
small size but continued on to his spirit. He was always full of energy. Rudy loved to run around the house, explore
the yard and when he got tired he would lay down and chew on his favorite stuffed giraffe.

Sadly, Rudy had a genetic predisposition to kidney failure and it only took 4 short years to get diagnosed. Shortly
    after being diagnosed, he past away. Rudy's lived a short life but he lived every day with a wagging tail.
