    Rudy
</h2>

<b>
One year Santa brought the Lynam more than just toys for Christmas. Instead of getting tooth paste and candy in their
stockings, Tommy and Miranda were thrilled to find a happy little puppy peeping his head out of the top of one on
Christmas morning. Do to the actuation they believed that naming the new addition to the family after Rodolph.
</b>

<b>
Rudy was a small yorke that seemed to never out grow the stage of being a puppy. His puppy parson did not stop at his
small size, but continued on to his spirit. He was always full of energy. Rudy loved to run around the house, explore
the yard and when he got tired he would lay down and chew on his favorite stuffed giraffe.
</b>

<b>
His energetic personality led him to run around the woods and taste anything that looked appealing. Unfortunately Rudy
was diagnosed with kidney failure as he grew old and pasted away soon after.
