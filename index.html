<h1>
  The Lynam Pups
</h1>

<p>
    Every family needs a little puppy running around the house. It doesn't matter if they're big, small, skinny, fat,
filled with energy or just like sleeping; a little fluff ball running around will never fail to add that special
something to the family tree. The Lynam's are proud to say that four of these little guys have adopted their last name
over the years. Their first dog was a yorke named Rudy. After he started getting sick Chloe was added to the family to
keep him company. After Chloe passed, the house felt empty without having someone to play with. Not before long the
    empty hole in the family tree was replaced with two yapping puppies.
