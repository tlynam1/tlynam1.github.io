<h1>
    The Lynam Pups
</h1>

<h2>
    Two Pups One Brain
</h2>

<b>
    After Chloe's death the Lynam's house felt empty. It was the first time in years that there wasn't a little fluff ball
    wandering around the house. After a few months Mrs. Lynam and Miranda, her daughter, decided to look go to the pet
    store to play with some dogs. They immediately fell in love with two little puppies. Mr. Lynam and Tom, their son,
    where shocked when they came home to find Cooper and Harley running around the house.

    Since that day, The two of them have never failed to put a smile on someone's face and are always by each other's
    side. Everyone who comes through the door is greeted by the two of them sprinting from the other side of the house
    and no one can help themselves from smiling and starting to play with them. Although they never fail to make everyone
    else happy, they are never more thrilled than when they see a squirrel in the yard. The two of them patiently
    wait, sitting at the door. As soon as the door opens, they fly to the tree and miss him by acouple feet everytime.
    Despite never catching one yet, it's still their favorite part of the day.

<h3>
    Cooper
</h3>

<p>
    Cooper is the type of dog that no one can get bad at. He is always happy and laid back. He always loves to crawl up
    in a ball up against you to take a nap and when he wants to get pet he just runs up to you and lays on his back
    while he shakes his tail.
</p>

<h3>
    Harley
</h3>

<p>
    Harley was a bit of a late bloomer. As a puppy she always lived in cooper's shadow but as she grew up she got a lot
    cuter. No matter where she goes she is always looking for attention with one of her favorite toys in her mouth
    and ready to play.
