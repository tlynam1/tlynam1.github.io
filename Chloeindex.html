    Soon after Rudy was diagnosed with kidney failure his mood changed. He went from being energetic and enthusiastic
    to tired and depressed. The Lynam family decided to add an addition to the family to make him feel better. As soon
    as Rudy met Chloe his whole demeanor changed. He was Chloe's father figure while she was a puppy. Although their
    time together was fairly short, their bond grew incredibly strong. After his death Chloe was never the same.

    Some could say it was just her way of maturing out of her puppy phase or the fact that she lost her best friend but
    despite the reasoning, she soon became very mellow. She grew into the ideal lap dog. She never learned how to play
    fetch, never decided to go exploring in the woods or run after squirrels. Instead she would just mossy around the
    house. She always seemed happy, just lazy. However, she did love crawling onto anyone's lap for a nap and follow
    her mom, Mrs. Lynam, everywhere she went.

    Chloe was a special dog, the type of dog that put a smile on your face no matter how bad your day was. Unfortunately,
    after 8 short years she met her untimely death when she wondered under a car pulling into the driveway. Her death
    shook the Lynam house hold. Despite Mr. Lynam refusing to admit that he likes dogs, the day she passed was one of
    the few times he let a tier drip down his cheek.
